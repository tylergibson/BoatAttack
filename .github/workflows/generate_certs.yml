# We conceptually only want to run this after our one-time setup
# The setup step adds a deploy key to our secrets, and this needs to be
# a separate workflow in order to pick up on the new ENV changes
#
# A possible future step would be to grab the deploy key value directly from 
# the output of the previous step instead of relying on ENV, but this works for now.
